This project aims to create a chat bot for asking questions related to the Swedish Parliament with the use of their REST API containing information on voting, attendants and debates.

The goal is to use the documents from the current mandate period and create a chatbot where the user will be able to ask questions about parties, candidates and debates to get information about stances and actions taken. Voting on subject matters will be used as well.

Through streamlit the user will be able to interact with the chatbot and get graphs over votings, debates and information about candidates. 

Lists on votes require the specific errand ID in the link to work.
